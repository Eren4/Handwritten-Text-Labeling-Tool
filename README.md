# Handwritten Text Labeling Tool
This was my Capstone Project in university  
The program is used to label the handwritten pngs in line and word level into the text files  
In total, there were 1596 handwritten forms filled by different students, but in this repository, only 3 of them are included to demonstrate how the program works  

Python needs to be installed to run the program  

Required modules:  
OpenCV  
Numpy  
Tkinter  
PIL  

The necessary pip installs for the modules are available on the internet
